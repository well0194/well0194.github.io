<article> About me </article>
<p> This is my first semester at Algonquin College. Before coming to college, I was working full time at the government and wasn't enjoying my job and decide to go through my design career. So far I'm enjoying learning about web design, photography and digital graphics. I've had a bit of experience in the past creating website through Weebly, and Wix. These website I created in the past were just for fun, I did help my one of my family members create a photography website for themselves and has been using it ever since. I've always loved creating websites but learning how to code through a website instead of having the applications already been uploaded is interesting to learn. One quote I aboustley love is <quote> "It's through mistakes that you actually can grow. You have to get bad in order to get good." Said Paula Scher </quote> I enjoy this quote, as everyone makes mistakes once you make a misktake you get better at your errors you make. I think so people actually forget about this. </p>

<p> I currently live in Ottawa and I'm looking for a part time job to have while contuining my college education. I have two <abbr = Londyn and Tucker> dogs </abbr> that I aboustley love! They are puggles, so mixed with beagle and pug. We got them from London, Ontario; they are from the same litter. They are very energetic and always getting themselves into <em> trouble </em> This will be their 7<sup> th </sup> year with us,and we always tend to spoil them on their birthday. I have always had dogs in my life, so owning a pet is a big part life. Another about me fact is that this year I'm really looking forward to traveling with my friends, I haven't ever left Ottawa. So leaving Ottawa is very exciting for me. This May long weekend, I went to my boyfirends racing event in Oshawa and it was incredible. Sometime in the Winter we are looking to go to Mexico for a few weeks, so I'm looking forward to that as well. Traveling has always been something I wanted to do, so I'm looking forward to travel in the future. I also wanted to mention I look forward to learning web design in your class! </p>
